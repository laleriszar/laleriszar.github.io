Just drag and drop a file onto your desktop, and you&rsquo;re ready to go! Second, they are beautiful. Most wallpaper files come in high-quality JPEGs or PNGs, which makes them perfect for displaying on your computer or phone. And finally, they&rsquo;re versatile. You can use them as a background for photos or videos, or as the main screen saver on your device. So if you&rsquo;re looking for an easy way to add some extra beauty and personality to your computer or phone, give wallpaper screens a try!</p><h2 id=chicago-pd-born-into-bad-news-photo-2363051---nbccom>Chicago P.D.: Born Into Bad News Photo: 2363051 - NBC.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chicago-pd-born-into-bad-news-photo-2363051---nbccom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://img.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/images/2015/5/20/18_NUP_168713_2298.JPG onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4JR1UWWILQIsM4YOYUvQgwHaLG&pid=15.1"' alt="Chicago P.D.: Born into Bad News Photo: 2363051 - NBC.com"><p><em>Source: nbc.com</em></p><blockquote><p>chicago pd voight fire season nbc born bad into hank tv finale preview beghe.</p></blockquote><p>The Best Way to Store Wallpapers: A Storage Solution for Your Collection
